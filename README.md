# CloudImageAlbum

A photo album web application, that can be searched using natural language through both text and voice. We will use Lex, ElasticSearch, and Rekognition to create an intelligent search layer to query your photos for people, objects, actions, landmarks and more.

The user can:

1. Visit the photo album application using the S3 hosted URL.
2. Search photos using natural language via voice and text.
3. See relevant results (ex. If we search for a cat,we should be able to see photos with cats in them) based on what you searched.
4. Upload new photos (with or without custom labels) and see them appear in the search results.
